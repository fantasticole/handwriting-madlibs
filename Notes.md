Essay response should be short like a "medium comment." What I thought was good, what I thought could use some work.

Arrive and come to the topic/theme

Blur out story content?
Cipher-shift story content?

Store one person's answer's in a data base to be referenced if it's shared.

Store a cookie or some information in a user's local storage.

More concerned about height, so have a fixed height. You can have fixed dimensions where the text resizes. 2/3 need to be set, height, width and handwriting size. Text would center if the word is short and the width is provided. They're not concerned about the white space.

Rendering on the client side exposes your key, not good for security. Having a server solves that, but not necessary. The backend would proxy the call to the api. It just adds in the keys.

Store the image in the css as a string. Have Node render the handwriting image and then render it was a string. That way the browser doesn't need to donwload it, it just renders the string as an image.

They'll want to hear my stories.

Potential issues: punctuation
